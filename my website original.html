	<h1> Work-at-Home solutions are in our DNA </h1> <br/>
	<img src="lady.png" alt=" ">
	<p> <ul> <li> 25+ years of delivering work-at-home solutions </li> <br/>
<li>25K+ work-at-home CXM associates</li> <br/>
<li>45K+ work-at-home associates overall </li> <br/> </ul> </p> <br/> <br/> <br/>
	<h1> Delivering business continuity in tough times </h1> <br/>
	<p> The COVID-19 pandemic has caught companies off guard. Organizations of every kind face significant challenges in keeping their contact centers and customer service channels operational. <br/> <br/>

In this environment, demand for WAH has increased exponentially — while nothing has changed about customers’ expectations to receive exceptional, human centric, omnichannel experiences, with zero business disruption.<br/> <br/>

Conduent’s scale, global reach, and digital capabilities deliver peace of mind and steadfast business continuity. During COVID-19, we have seamlessly moved tens of thousands of associates across 20 countries to a WAH model.<br/> <br/>

Conduent’s CX associates continue to deliver outstanding service with empathy, precision, and passion from their homes — with CSAT scores steadily climbing in spite of the odds. </p>  <br/> 
	<p> <ul>  <li>  Global presence </li>  <br/>
<li> Full-time, part-time or flex time </li> <br/>
<li>Omnichannel communications delivery </li> <br/>
<li> Proven performance in times of crisis  </li> </ul> </p>  <br/> 
	<h1> Providing operational flexibility </h1> <br/>
	<p> Our associates are located across geographies, including North America, EMEA, Asia Pacific, and LATAM. Due to a balanced geographic distribution, we are able to quickly and effectively transition associates to a Work-at-Home model in any region. <br/> <br/>

For example, we can provide Spanish language support from either Guatemala or Philippines, and both locations have Work-at-Home capabilities. <br/> <br/>

For over 25 years, Conduent has hired, onboarded, and trained thousands of Work-at-Home associates online at a global scale — proving we can ramp up quickly anywhere, based on client demands. </p> <br/>
		<h1> Managing operational risk </h1>	
	<p> Clients decide the extent to which they want Work-at-Home solutions in their delivery models — most preferring a blend of “brick and mortar” and remote solutions.  <br/>  <br/>

Depending on the client, 70%-80% of CXM associates are now working from home. That trend is likely to continue. </p>  <br/>

		<h1> Good for business and good for employees too </h1> <br/>
 	<p> A Work-at-Home delivery model improves employee morale, work-life balance, and in most cases, leads to higher employee retention. <br/> <br/>

Our model brings tangible benefits that positively impact client outcomes: </p>  <br/>

	<p> <ul> <li> Operational flexibility </li> <br/>
<li>Lower attrition </li> <br/>
<li>Reduced absenteeism </li> <br/>
<li>Enhanced productivity </li> <br/>
<li>Increased employee satisfaction  </li> </ul>  </p> <br/> <br/>

	<h1> Online training and collaboration drive operational excellence </h1>  <br/>
	<p> onduent ensures that every associate has the resources they need to do their jobs — including proper training and on-the-job coaching specific to the accounts and industries they serve. <br/> <br/>

With decades of Virtual Instructor-Led Training (VILT) experience, Conduent provides extensive online training for both new and existing agents. The online training is supplemented with on-the-job coaching by seasoned experts who understand the WAH model and can help </p> <br/> <br/><br/> 

		<h1>  Keeping your information secure is our #1 priority </h1>
	<p> Our clients count on us with their mission-critical information every day, and we are 100% committed to its protection.  <br/> <br/>

Secure technology platforms, regular training on privacy and information security, and continuous communication with associates ensures proper management oversight of security guidelines in a WAH delivery model.  <br/> <br/>
